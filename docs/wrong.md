# The record

Measurements that argued against a change, whether or not code changed.
The entry is the deliverable. Same discipline as the sibling repos.

## The selective-skip ratio is the group-skip factor, and absolute latency is next

First engine measurement, 1M rows in ten 100K-row groups, a 1/50th time
window with an equality predicate against a forced full scan of all ten
groups:

    selective-window   131 ms
    full-scan         6616 ms   50x

The 50x is exactly the skip factor -- the window overlaps one group of
fifty, and the other nine are never opened. That is the design's premise
confirmed at the engine level. The absolute 131 ms is not yet good: the
survivor group still decodes its whole _msg dict and materializes every
matched row's fields eagerly. The design's "decode selected lanes only"
is the lever there, and lazy per-lane materialization is the next query
change -- recorded here so the number is honest before it improves.
